# Conway's Game of Life!

# About this game
Conway's Game of Life is a fascinating cellular automaton imagined by mathematician John Conway. It is a game that doesn't need players but evolves based on its initial setup. Imagine a grid of cells, where each cell can either be alive or dead. Here's how it works:

# Setup
You start by placing living cells on the grid. For now, this is done randomly.

# Neighbors matter
Each cell observes its eight neighbors â€“ the cells surrounding it horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

# Rules of life and death
Birth: A dead cell with exactly three living neighbors comes to life in the next generation.

Survival: A living cell with two or three living neighbors remains alive in the next generation.

Death:
A living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies of loneliness.
A living cell with more than three living neighbors dies due to overcrowding.

Next generation:
After simultaneously applying these rules to each cell on the grid, a new generation is created. This new layout replaces the old one, and the cycle continues.

# What can happen
With each new generation, various outcomes are possible:

Stable patterns: Some configurations reach a stable state where no further changes occur.

Oscillation: Certain patterns oscillate between different configurations, repeating themselves cyclically.

Growth or decay: Other configurations may grow indefinitely, stabilize into a repetitive pattern, or disappear completely.

Despite its simplicity, Conway's Game of Life reveals incredibly complex behaviors. It is used in fields such as computer science and biology.
